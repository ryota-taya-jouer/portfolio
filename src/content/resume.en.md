## Summary

I have experience in web backend development centered on Python and Django, building and operating infrastructure on AWS, and developing payment features with Stripe.

In developing e-commerce sites and web services, I have covered a wide range of phases: requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and monitoring/incident investigation. I am particularly strong in implementing APIs and business logic with Django, Stripe payments, scheduled batch jobs on AWS Lambda, log investigation with CloudWatch, and setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

I currently also work with technologies such as Next.js/FastAPI, Swift/SwiftUI, and AI coding agents, building web services and iOS apps as personal projects.

## Applicable Experience, Knowledge & Skills

- **Web backend development**: Backend development of web applications centered on Python/Django. Implementation of APIs, authentication, payments, external service integrations, and batch processing, as well as maintenance and operation of systems running on AWS, log investigation, and CI/CD setup.
- **Payment feature development**: Design and implementation of payment features using Stripe, working with PaymentIntent, Invoice, SetupIntent, Subscription, Webhooks, and more. Coverage includes credit card payments, convenience store payments, recurring billing, invoicing, handling failed payments, and duplicate-payment prevention — not just the happy path, but error cases and incident response as well.
- **Infrastructure construction & operation**: Building and operating web applications and scheduled batch jobs using EC2, Aurora MySQL, Lambda, EventBridge, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions, AWS SAM, and more.
- **Testing & quality management**: Automated testing with pytest, Selenium, and Playwright; code quality management with ruff/pre-commit; and CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions.
- **Incident investigation & log analysis**: Chunked retrieval and root-cause investigation of large log volumes using CloudWatch Logs Insights and structured logging.
- **Adoption of new technologies**: Web service development with Next.js/FastAPI and iOS app development with Swift/SwiftUI. Practical use of AI development tools such as Claude Code and ChatGPT to streamline the development process from requirements definition through implementation, testing, and review.

## Strengths & Areas of Expertise

### 1. Web backend development with Django

Using Django and Django REST Framework, I can implement APIs, authentication, payments, business logic, caching, and external service integrations. I can add features, fix bugs, and refactor existing systems while verifying their specifications and the scope of impact.

### 2. Payment feature development with Stripe

I have designed and implemented payment features using PaymentIntent, Invoice, SetupIntent, Subscription, Webhooks, and more. Beyond the happy path, I can implement and troubleshoot with failed payments, duplicate processing, retries, asynchronous events, rate limits, and object conflicts in mind.

### 3. System operation and automation on AWS

I can build and operate systems combining EC2, Aurora MySQL, Lambda, EventBridge, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions, and more. This includes moving scheduled batch jobs to serverless, setting up CI/CD, log investigation, monitoring alerts, permission management, and network architecture design.

### 4. Incident investigation & log analysis

Using CloudWatch Logs Insights and application logs, I can pinpoint where errors occur and trace the flow of requests. I can investigate root causes by combining multiple sources of information: chunked retrieval of large log volumes, structured-log analysis, external API errors, payment errors, Django exceptions, and more.

### 5. Testing & CI/CD

Using pytest, Selenium, Playwright, GitHub Actions, and more, I can set up unit tests, API tests, E2E tests, and automated deployment. I can incrementally introduce linting, formatting, testing, and deploy automation into existing projects.

### 6. Development efficiency with AI tools

I use Claude Code, ChatGPT, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and other tools to streamline requirements gathering, writing implementation instructions, code review, test design, and bug investigation. Rather than adopting AI-generated code as-is, I develop while verifying consistency with specifications, maintainability, security, and test results.
